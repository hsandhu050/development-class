            <span class="yt">
                How can one talk about Bryant’s scoring prowess and not mention this first and foremost? The rings, the accolades, all of it was amazing, but this was legendary. Take three minutes and watch every point again. It’s worth it.<br />

                There really aren’t any more adjectives or phrases to accurately describe what happened. The Lakers were getting smacked by the Raptors, and then Bryant took it to a ridiculous, otherworldly level, scoring 55 points in the second half. Goodness.
